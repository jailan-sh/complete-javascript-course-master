# Course Material and FAQ for my Complete JavaScript Course

This branch of the repo contains starter files and final code for all sections and projects of the course, **exactly as shown in the videos**.

Use starter code to start each section, and **final code to compare it with your own code whenever something doesn't work**!

There is also a the [updates-and-fixes](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course/tree/updates-and-fixes) branch which is kept up-to-date with **latest package updates and important bugfixes üêõ**

üö® **_Please read the following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) carefully before starting the course_** üö®

## FAQ

### Q1: How do I download the files?

**A:** If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the entire code, hit the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option. If you can't see the button (on mobile), use [this link](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann/complete-javascript-course/archive/master.zip) instead.

### Q2: I'm stuck! Where do I get help?

**A:** Have you actually tried to fix the problem on your own? **Have you compared your code to the final code?** If you failed fixing your problem, please **post a detailed description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy**, along with a [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/) containing your code. You will get help there. Please don't send me a personal message or email to fix coding problems.

### Q3: What VSCode theme are you using?

**A:** I use Monokai Pro for all my coding and course production. It's a paid theme (I', **not** affiliated with them), but you can actually use the free demo version forever üòÖ

### Q4: Can I see a final version of the course projects?

**A:** Sure! Here you go:
